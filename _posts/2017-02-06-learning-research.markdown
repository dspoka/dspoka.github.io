*Goal: Detail the way in which I try to keep up with new research*

# **Inputs**
- [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/): subscription to several email lists (not the cleanest of interfaces but gets the job done).
- [Arxiv Sanity Preserver](http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/): Andrej Karpathy's project
- [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/): What I really like is how easy it is to pull out the graphics and figures.
- [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/): it allows you to set alerts when new papers get added based on certain keywords. I haven't found this to be very useful since its hard to get the keywords such that the amount of papers being forwarded isn't too large or too small.
- Weekly Email Lists
    + [The Wild Week in AI](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/wildml): Denny Britz runs this cool weekly email list on AI and Deep Learning. I like it because it highlights a couple of the most important research papers from the week but also shows some interesting applications and projects.
    + [Deep Learning Weekly](http://www.deeplearningweekly.com/): a weekly newsletter on Deep Learning (very similar to Denny's).

# **More Code Oriented**
- [Gitxiv](http://www.gitxiv.com/): here you can find implementations of a lot of papers on archive. They have bounties for papers that are most wanted.
- [Tensortalk](https://tensortalk.com/): another avenue for finding interesting projects in deep learning.
- [Deep Learning Gallery](http://deeplearninggallery.com/): a curated list of awesome deep learning projects. They don't get updated too often.

# **Organization and Understanding**
- [Papers App](http://papersapp.com/): I'm starting to use this more organize my reading list as well as necessary papers for different projects. The ability to collaborate and share reading lists is nice. Don't like how poorly the notes get exported with the paper.
- [Deep Learning Paper Notes](https://github.com/dennybritz/deeplearning-papernotes): another place to find not only the good research papers as they are coming out but also find some of Denny's compact summaries.
