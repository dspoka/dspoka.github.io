*How would you map the ocean currents?*

There are some things you might want to consider before you build your solution and raise venture capital:

**Background:**

As defined, an ocean current is a directed movement of ocean water. 

The three types of currents formed are coastal, surface ocean and the Global Conveyor Belt. **Since we wish to optimize for ocean trade routes, we will not worry about coastal currents, which affect very small regions, or the Global Conveyor Belt, which moves water very slowly.**

This means that it is the surface ocean currents that need mapping.

Immediately my mind jumps to a network of ocean buoys with sensors and a Raspberry Pi that are all communicating with some satellites flying high in the exosphere…

But that might be **reinventing the wheel**--how were the first comprehensive maps of ocean currents made over 150 years ago?


**The Pathfinder:**

In 1825, 19 year old Matthew Fontaine Maury joined the United States Navy as a midshipman. Fascinated with the motion of the seas, he  spent time recording wind and weather conditions as he and his crew glided over the waves.. In 1839 Maury broke his leg in a stagecoach accident and headed to work for the Navy’s Depot of Charts and Instruments. 

**The Data:**

Dissatisfied with the lack of charts in his Charts and Instruments organization he put to use thousands of old logbooks from Navy ships. These logs contained records of dates, locations, directions and speeds of the wind, and the course of the ships. Immediately he saw the value of these records and began a **tediuos** process of compiling. He saw that the way ships would adjust their course was to compensate for them drifting aside by currents. In 1847 he published his findings in book Wind and Current Chart of the North Atlantic. His mapped currents allowed ships to travel much faster through the open waters. 

**Could elaborate—make very obvious how his comprehensive guides meant that ships could anticipate currents and drift, rather than retroactively correcting their courses and again reinventing the wheel on each journey.  i.e., “Maury’s guidebook offered unprecedented opportunities for improving navigation…”**

**Bottle Learning:**
In 1853 Maury called for an international conference in Brussels, Belgium, to help standardize navigational practices. In exchange for his charts, he asked the sailors from international trade routes to help him gather more information.  These sailors would record their location and date on a piece of paper that they would then put in a bottle and throw into the sea. They would also pick up any bottles that they saw and record where and when the bottles were found. Maury would aggregate this crowdsourced information and improve his charts. Due to Maury’s contributions to his newly formed field, Oceanography, he earned himself the nickname “Pathfinder of the Seas”.

**So What?:**

It seems fitting that the first entry to my blog about humans and technology has no real **mention/descrition** of technology. It is a story of man **who followed his curiousity of nature** saw a problem, found a new use for existing information and established an industry standard in the process. Although now, we do use buoys with sensors it is important to be able to come up with the simple baseline solution.

**Elegant solution**
Emphasize to find the simple, and maybe how thats very common in industry rn
