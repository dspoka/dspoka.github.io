How would you map the ocean's currents?

Wait, before you build your solution and raise money from vc's some background.

**Background:**

As defined, an ocean current is a directed movement of ocean water. 

There are three main factors responsible for generating currents: gravity between the earth and the moon, wind, and thermohaline circulation (temperature and salinity differences).

The three types of currents formed are coastal, surface ocean and the Global Conveyor Belt. Since we wish to optimize for ocean trade routes we will not worry about coastal currents which are affect very small regions or the Global Conveyor Belt which moves water very slowly. 

This means that it is the surface ocean currents that need to be mapped.

Immediately my mind jumps to a network of ocean buoys with sensors all communicating with some satellite. 

But how were the first comprehensive maps of ocean currents made over 150 years ago?

**The Pathfinder:**

In 1825, 19 year old Matthew Fontaine Maury joined the United States Navy as a midshipman. Fascinated with the motion of the seas his crew glided over he spent time recording wind and weather conditions. In 1839 Maury broke his leg in a stagecoach accident and headed to work for the Navy's Depot of Charts and Instruments. 

**The Data:**

(Confused) with the lack of charts in his organization he put to use thousands of old logbooks from Navy ships. These logs contained records of dates, locations, directions and speeds of the wind, and the course of the ships. Immediately he saw the value of these records and began a tediuos process of compiling. He saw that the way the ships would adjust their course was a result of them drifting because of the currents. In 1847 he published his findings in book Wind and Current Chart of the North Atlantic. His mapped currents allowed ships to travel much faster through the open waters.

**Gathering More Data:**

In 1853 Maury called for an international conference in Brussels, Belgium to help standardize navigational practices. In exchange for his charts of shortcuts he asked the sailors from international trade routes to help him gather more info. These sailors would record their location and date on a piece of paper that they would then put in a bottle and throw into the sea. They would also pick up any bottles that they saw and record where and when they were picked up. Maury would aggregate this crowdsourced information and improve his charts. 

**So What?:**

It seems fitting that the first entry to my blog about humans and technology has no real mention of technology. It is a story of man who saw a problem, found a new use to existing information and established an industry standard in the process. Although now, we do use buoys with sensors it is important to be able to come up with the simple baseline solution.

Due to Maury's contributions to his newly formed field he earned himself the nickname "Pathfinder of the Seas".
